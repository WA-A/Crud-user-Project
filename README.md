# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

- ## curd_user
- It is the first project in React to create ideas such as displaying data from the game, creating new data with the user and displaying it on a second page. The user can also delete specific data or display the details of this data, edit, and control through id.
- 
The postman API was dealt with where each process has its own url
